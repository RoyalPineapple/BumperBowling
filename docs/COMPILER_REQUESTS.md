# Compiler Requests

Bumper Bowling 0.1 is SwiftSyntax-first. When a rule needs type-checked truth, it belongs on this list instead of being smuggled into syntax-only linting.

These are requests for a future compiler-backed analysis lane.

## Typed String Matching

SwiftSyntax can observe operator tokens and member-call spelling. It can catch obvious direct string matching such as:

```swift
name.rawValue == "ready"
name.hasSuffix("State")
```

It cannot prove every arbitrary `==`, `!=`, `contains`, `hasPrefix`, or `hasSuffix` expression is actually operating on `String`.

Compiler-backed analysis would let Bumper Bowling ask:

- Is either side of this comparison type-checked as `String` or `Substring`?
- Does this `contains` call resolve to string matching or collection membership?
- Does this `hasPrefix` or `hasSuffix` call resolve to the standard string API?

This would turn `NoDirectStringMatching` from a conservative syntax rule into a precise typed rule.

## Inferred Type Facts

SwiftSyntax sees explicit type annotations. It does not infer:

```swift
let id = "abc"
```

Compiler-backed analysis would let Bumper Bowling treat inferred `String`, `Any`, broad existential, and domain identity types the same way it treats explicit annotations.

## Symbol And Module Truth

SwiftSyntax sees imports and names. It does not resolve symbols or prove which module owns a referenced declaration.

Compiler-backed analysis would let Bumper Bowling distinguish:

- declared dependency edges from actual symbol usage
- unused imports from real dependencies
- same-spelled declarations from the symbol actually referenced

## Build Target Truth

SwiftSyntax reads files. It does not know final build target membership after package, Xcode, conditional compilation, or build setting decisions.

Compiler-backed analysis would let Bumper Bowling attach facts to the targets the compiler actually builds.
